## Setup

<!--
1. Setup GymRun to automatically backup to Google Drive.
2. Use [GPSOauth] to get the master token of your account.
    ```python
    import gpsoauth

    email = 'example@gmail.com'  # Your Google account email
    password = 'my-password'  # Your Google account password, if you have 2FA, use an “app password”
    android_id = '0123456789abcdef'  # Get it from `adb shell 'settings get secure android_id'`

    # As of July 2023, you need to install OpenSSL 1.* and urllib3 1.26.16 to make this work.
    # Install urllib3 1.* with `pip install urllib3==1.26.16`.
    # Check your OpenSSL version with `python -c "import ssl; print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)"`.
    master_response = gpsoauth.perform_master_login(email, password, android_id)
    master_token = master_response['Token']
    # Master token usually starts with `aas_et/`
    print(master_token)
    ```
4. Create a `.env` file as the example.
5. Run the Flask server at `app.py`.
